load pseudo code :
// the following under assumption that dictionary is all of small letters and only a character '\'' extra to be allowed

for every word's charcter
    check if it's '\''
                then save it at index #26
        else it
            shift the charcter by subtracting from 97;
               // results in range (0 - 25)

        check the value @ children

            if NULL
                malloc a new node and have children[i] points to it.
                save it at the corresponding index in children array;

            else
                move to new node and continue

        if @ end of word
            set is_word to true
