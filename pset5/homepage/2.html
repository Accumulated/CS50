<b><u><i>1- </i></u></b>‘Come get your armor, nerds!’ said RonBurgundy69.
He placed a container on the ground and danced around it.
 I wish he could’ve seen my grin.
</p></td>
<td><p>
<b><u><i>2- </i></u></b>It was the kind of small light-hearted gesture that kept an entire
evening of Rainbow Six Siege from teetering off into a hapless
 string of simple mistakes, head-to-keyboard contact,
 and creative insult slinging. Because without teamwork,
 no matter how messy, Siege is just another deathmatch shooter,
 one where you can reinforce or smash walls.</p></td>

<b><u><i>3- </i></u></b>But with teamwork, Siege is a game where you can reinforce
or smash walls and tiny, fleeting relationships—more
 dating sim than twitch test, and it’s this special
 social element, combined with an impressive amount
of tactical depth that makes
Siege one of the best competitive shooters I’ve played.
</p></td>
<td><p>
<b><u><i>4- </i></u></b>Rainbow Six Siege’s primary mode is five-on-five
 objective-based multiplayer, with each team either
defending or attacking an objective.
</p></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
<td><p>
<b><u><i>5- </i></u></b>But you don’t just get thrown in and shoot one another willy-nilly.
 Every round opens with a planning phase, in which
 the defending team uses character abilities and resources
 (wall reinforcements, barbed wire, traps, explosives) to slow down,
 distract, or destroy the enemy team’s encroachment. </p></td>
<td><p>
<b><u><i>6- </i></u></b>During this phase, the attacking team sends in
 tiny remote control drones to sneakily survey the defense.
Holding down a button marks the last spotted
position of defending players, while other defensive structures
 are communicated over voice chat. While this is happening,
each team is ideally coming up with a strategy.</p></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
<td><p>
<b><u><i>7- </i></u></b>Most tactical games take a while to get there:
 the tipping point where I’m no longer
struggling with controls, communication,
or match flow. After the first match in a
typical game of Siege, I know my role, my team
 and I have developed a relationship, and
 we’re settling into a unique rhythm.</p></td>
