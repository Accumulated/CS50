<b><u><i>1- </i></u></b>Watch Dogs’ completely open map is another big strength:
it’s huge, diverse, and intricately detailed.
The rural area of Pawnee balances out Chicago’s urban sprawl,
and it all looks great, especially at sunset or during a rainstorm.
Everything runs at a smooth 30 frames per second,
however, after playing for a few hours
I did start to experience frequent slowdowns when
new mission objectives were loading up.

<td><p>
<b><u><i>2- </i></u></b>Fortunately they never happened when anything interesting was going on,
but they’re definitely noticeable and get progressively worse as the story goes on.
Over more than 20 hours, the straightforward revenge story becomes more
and more complex until it’s bursting with intrigue... only to take a strange
turn for the mundane when the motivations behind it all are revealed.
For a game that deals with themes like surveillance society and
media manipulation , Watch Dogs’ villains just aren’t thinking very big.</p></td>

<b><u><i>3- </i></u></b>It can last a lot longer than 20 hours though, because
Watch Dogs is extremely good at distracting attention
away from the main story with a steady stream of
side quests and minigames. I’m a big fan of the gang hideout missions,
which really let you test your stealth skills as you take down well-guarded
targets (though it’s kinda strange that they ask you to keep the
gang leader alive but are cool with murdering everyone else).
</p></td>
<td><p>
<b><u><i>4- </i></u></b>Most of the other activities can get repetitive, like the pre-crime
interventions that always result in the same foot chase, but there are
so many types, from criminal convoy ambushes to chess and poker to drinking,
that they don’t get old quickly if you mix up what you play. Oh, and the simple
but delightful Spider Tank rampage shouldn’t be missed.
There was definitely some tender love and care put into
the way that monstrosity moves.

<b><u><i>5- </i></u></b>I had quite a rant written about how busted the PC version
of Watch Dogs was at launch, with both Uplay issues that prevented
me from playing at all for the first two days and massive
stuttering problems even on low settings making it nearly
unplayable on two different PCs once I did.</p></td>
<td><p>
<b><u><i>6- </i></u></b>I was mere hours from posting a review on Sunday with a
greatly reduced score attached when a patch resolved most
of my performance problems. [Note: I can only assume there was
a stealth patch, since it simply started running well where it had
not before.] Watch Dogs on PC still isn't a fantastically well optimized
game, but my nearly four-year-old GTX 570 is able to deliver over 30fps
(sometimes over 60) on medium settings. I do experience a few dropped</p></td>

<b><u><i>7- </i></u></b>frames here and there, but as of this writing it's otherwise just as good
as the PS4 version (better, if you've got newer hardware) and just as easy
to recommend. Naturally you do have to suffer through the inconvenience of
Ubisoft's Uplay login nonsense, and Aiden's smartphone menu system is a
pain to navigate with the mouse.</p></td>
