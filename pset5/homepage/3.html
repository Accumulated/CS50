<b><u><i>1- </i></u></b>some of the best films of all time are those whose
 different strengths all work in concert to create
 a unified, engrossing whole. The Shining,
The Social Network, and Jaws are all excellent
examples of films made up of strong individual parts
complementing each other to form a fantastic work of art.
</p></td>
<td><p>
<b><u><i>2- </i></u></b> That is absolutely true of God of War – its musical
score elevates story moments, which flow seamlessly
into fantastic action gameplay, which facilitates
exploration and puzzles that reward you with a deeper
 understanding of its characters and its expansive and
 beautiful world.</p></td>

<b><u><i>3- </i></u></b> God of War is a masterful composition of exceptional
 interlocking parts, deliberate in its design and its
 foreshadowing, which pays off in unexpected ways in
both the gameplay and story.
</p></td>
<td><p>
<b><u><i>4- </i></u></b>Set in a new, Norse mythology-inspired world and
starring a familiar but thoughtfully reimagined
character, God of War’s fish-out-of-Greek-water
tale is a nonstop whirlwind of emotions.

<b><u><i>5- </i></u></b>It’s all framed by one continuous camera shot that
never cuts away or takes the focus off of the heart
of it all: Kratos’ relationship with his young son,
 Atreus. </p></td>
<td><p>
<b><u><i>6- </i></u></b>
But the story also encompasses an indelible
supporting cast, a gorgeous world consistently
 rewarding to explore, and immensely satisfying combat.</p></td>

<b><u><i>7- </i></u></b>
God of War works from minute one thanks to the
simplicity of its plot. Kratos and Atreus – who
start as, at best, acquaintances – begin their
journey having just gone through the loss of
Kratos’ wife, whom Atreus bonded with much more
 than his father. The two set out to the
tallest point in all the realms to carry out her final wishes.</p></td>
